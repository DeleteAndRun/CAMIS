title: "Friedman Chi-Square test using R package rstatix"
---

# **Example: Simulated dataset with 10 subjects each having results at each of the 4 time points.**

Simulated datasets with continuous endpoints are generated for single-drug repeated measurements to check whether any significance exists between the responses at different time points. The p-value will indicate whether differences in response for different time points are significant.

*Data source:*

```{r, output = FALSE, message = FALSE}
library(dplyr)
library(rstatix) 
```

```{r eval=FALSE}
set.seed(123)

Onewayrepeat = data.frame(subject = rep(1:10, each=4),
                          timepoint = rep(c(1, 2, 3, 4), times=10),
                          Response =round(runif(n = 40, 10, 50)))

head(Onewayrepeat)
```

## Overview

The friedman.test() function from the R package 'rstatix' computes the following:

-   Friedman chi-squared statistic

-   its degrees of freedom and

-   p-value for checking whether the mean response is the same for all the time points.

**Missing Values**

when the data contain NAs. the function Defaults to getOption("na.action") which discards the row with NAs

## Example Code

## **Freidman Chi-Square test**

```{r eval=FALSE}
friedman.test(y=Onewayrepeat$Response, groups=Onewayrepeat$timepoint, blocks=Onewayrepeat$subject)
```

where: y - a vector of response values. groups - a vector of values indicating the "group" an observation belongs in. blocks - a vector of values indicating the "blocking" variable.
