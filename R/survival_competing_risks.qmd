title: "Competing Risks Analysis Using R"
---

# Introduction

In this document we investigate how to implement competing risk analysis in R. In particular, we focus on the basic competing risks model where each subject experiences only one of the possible *k* events as depicted in the figure below.

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', out.width="25%"}
knitr::include_graphics("../images/survival_competing_risks/cr.jpg")
```

## Data used

Just a sentence or two about the data. Consider using a package like {skimr} to help illustrate the data.

## Example Code

### Example using {package name}

**Optional** if there is more than one package

## Comparison

If you are comparing more than one package or between different languages, consider adding in a table to illustrate some of the differences. When comparing between languages it can be nice to have a table with links to the pages with deeper dive of each language for a given method method like this table from the ANCOVA page:

| Analysis                                      | Supported in R          | Supported in SAS          | Results Match | Notes                                                                                    |
|---------------|---------------|---------------|---------------|---------------|
| ANCOVA using general linear model and lsmeans | [Yes](../R/ancova.html) | [Yes](../SAS/ancova.html) | [Yes](#comp)  | `GLM()` function from **sasLM** with `EMEANS=TRUE` is the easiest to use and matches SAS |

But, even if you are just comparing the difference in same language it can be helpful to have a table with values of interest across different packages. Using dynamic content you can add the values to a table without manually putting in each value

## Conclusion

**Optional** add a conclusion
