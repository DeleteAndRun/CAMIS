title: "Estimating Cumulative Incidence Functions Using R"
---

## Objective

In this document we present how to estimate cumulative incidence functions (CIFs) for the probability of experiencing a certain event at a given time in a competing risks model in R. We focus on the basic model where each subject experiences only one out of *k* possible events as depicted in the figure below.

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', out.width="25%"}
##knitr::include_graphics(paste0(getwd(), "/images/survival_competing_risks/cr.jpg"))
knitr::include_graphics("../images/survival_competing_risks/cr.jpg")
```

In addition, we are interested in R packages and functions that are relatively easy to implement, and provide analyses and results comparable to those given by SAS.

## R Packages for Estimating CIFs

The `cmprsk` package (version 2.2-12, release date 2024-05-14) implements the methods described in Gray (1988) and Fine & Gray (1999). These are the the same methods implemented by the SAS procedure LIFETEST, a default choice for estimating CIFs.

The R functions in this document are tested using R version 4.3.1 (2023-06-16) on platform x86_64-pc-linux-gnu (64-bit).

### Data used

The bone marrow transplant (BTM) dataset as presented by Guo & So (2018) is used. The dataset has the following variables:

-   `Group` has three levels, indicating three disease groups.

-   `T` is the disease-free survival time in days. A derived variable `TYears = T/365.25` is used in the analysis.

-   `Status` has value 0 if `T` is censored; 1 if `T` is time to relapse; 2 if `T` is time to death.

-   `WaitTime` is the waiting time to transplant in days. A log transformation is applied to stabilize the large variation.

```{r readdata, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
require(dplyr)
bmt <- read.delim(file.path("../data/bmt.txt")) %>%
  ##read.delim(paste0(getwd(), "/data/bmt.txt")) %>%
  mutate(Group = factor(Group, 
                        levels = c(1, 2, 3), 
                        labels = c('ALL', 'AML-Low Risk', 'AML-High Risk')
                        ),
         Status = factor(Status,
                         levels = c(0, 1, 2),
                         labels = c('Censored', 'Relapse', 'Death')),
         TYears = T / 365.25
         )
require(tidycmprsk)
require(Surv)
```

## Estimating the CIFs

### CIF Estimates and Gray's Test

```{r cif.est, message=FALSE}
bmt.cif <- cmprsk::cuminc(ftime = bmt$TYears, 
                          fstatus = bmt$Status, 
                          group = bmt$Group, 
                          cencode = 'Censored')
print(bmt.cif)
```
### Confidence Intervals for the Estimated CIF

The function `cuminc{cmprsk}` does not provide the pointwise confidence intervals (CIs) for the CIF estimates. Users can calculate these the CIs using any existing methods. For example, the following code can be used to derive the 95% CIs with the log-log transformations (cf. Pintilie (2006)).

```{r cif.ci, message=FALSE}
bmt.cif.ALLR <- as.data.frame(bmt.cif$`ALL Relapse`) %>%
  mutate(ci.low = est^exp(-1 * qnorm(.975) * sqrt(var) / (est * (log(est)))),
         ci.upp = est^exp( 1 * qnorm(.975) * sqrt(var) / (est * (log(est))))
         )
```

Another point to note is that `cuminc{cmprsk}` estimates the variance of the CIF estimates asymptotically as in Aalen (1978). There is no option to change it to other methods. ds
