## Introduction

There are many different methods of calculating a confidence interval for a proportion (percentage). For more technical derivation and reasons for use for each of the methods listed below, see the corresponding [SAS page](https://psiaims.github.io/CAMIS/SAS/ci_for_prop.html).

## General Comparison Table

The following table provides an overview of the results comparing between R and SAS. See the corresponding [SAS page](https://psiaims.github.io/CAMIS/SAS/ci_for_prop.html) and [R page](https://psiaims.github.io/CAMIS/R/ci_for_prop.html) for results showing a single set of data run through both SAS and R.
