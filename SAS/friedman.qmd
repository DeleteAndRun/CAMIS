\### **Getting Started**

To build unreplicated blocked data, we'll create a data frame called `df_bp` from random number.

### Data used {.unnumbered}

`bp` will be the dependent variable. `subjid` serves as block and `time_point` as group.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
data df_bp(drop=i);
call streaminit(123);
do subjid = "0", "1", "2", "3", "4";
    do i = 1 to 10;
     time_point = strip(put(i, best.));
     bp = 138 + floor(61*rand("UNIFORM"));
     output;
         end;
     end;
run;

```

### Friedman's test {.unnumbered}

For this example, we're testing for a significant difference in median `bp` of different time points using `CMH2` option of **PROC FREQ**.

```{r, eval=FALSE}

proc freq data=df_bp;
   tables subjid*time_point*bp / 
   cmh2 scores=rank noprint;
run;

```

In the result window, the Row Mean Scores Differ statistic would be identical to Friedman's chi-square and the p-value indicates whether there is significant difference.
