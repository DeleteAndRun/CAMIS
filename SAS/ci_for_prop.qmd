## Introduction

We often experience data which is a binary endpoint ( 'response' vs 'non-response' for example). We want to calculate the proportion of patients responding, including a confidence interval around that estimate. Unlike normally distributed continuous data, where you can use the normal distibution equation: \
mean +/- 1.96 \* standard error

The calculation for proportions requires various assumptions, and approximations and there are many different methods to
