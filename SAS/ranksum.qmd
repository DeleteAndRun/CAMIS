# Mann-Whitney U/Wilcoxon rank sum test

The CMH procedure tests for conditional independence in partial contingency tables for a 2 x 2 x K design. However, it can be generalized to tables of X x Y x K dimensions.

## CMH in SAS

The cmh test is calculated in SAS using the PROC FREQ procedure. By default, it outputs the chi square statistic, degrees of freedom and p-value for each of the three alternative hypothesis: `general association`, `row means differ`, and `nonzero correlation`. It is up to the statistical analyst or statistician to know which result is appropriate for their analysis.

When the design of the contingency table is 2 x 2 x K (i.e, X == 2 levels, Y == 2 levels, K \>= 2 levels), the Mantel-Haenszel Common Odds Ratio (odds ratio estimate, 95% CI, P-value) and the Breslow-Day Test for Homogeneity of the Odds Ratios (chi-square statistic, degrees of freedom, P-value) are also output.

Below is the syntax to conduct a CMH analysis in SAS:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
Proc freq data = filtered_data; 
tables K * X * Y / cmh; 
* the order of K, X, and Y appearing on the line is important!;
run; 

```
