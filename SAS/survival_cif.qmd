title: "Estimating Cumulative Incidence Functions Using SAS"
---

## Objective

In this document we present how to estimate the cumulative incidence function (CIF) in SAS (version 9.4). We focus on the competing risks model where each subject experiences only one out of *k* possible events as depicted in the figure below.

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', out.width="25%"}
knitr::include_graphics("../images/survival_competing_risks/cr.jpg")
```

## Estimating CIFs in SAS

```{r eval=FALSE}
libname lib "..\data";
data dat;
  set lib.bmt.txt;
lenfoly = round(lenfol/365.25, 0.01);  /* change follow-up days to years for better visualization*/
run;
```
